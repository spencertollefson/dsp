# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > 1. **pwd [NAME]** - shows the current working directory path
    2. **mkdir [NAME]** - creates a directory
    3. **rm -rf [NAME]** *or* **rmdir [NAME] (only if empty)** - deletes the directory. The -r option is recursive and allows all subfiles and subdirectories to be deleted as well. The -f option is to force this potentially dangerous option through.
    4. **touch [NAME]** - this command creates a new file
    5. **rm [NAME]** - this command deletes a file
    6. **mv [OLDNAME] [NEWNAME}** - this command in effect renames files
    7. **ls -a** - this command shows all files, including hidden ones
    8. **cp [OLDFILE] [NEWFILEPATH] - this command copies a file
    9. **head [NAME]** - this command shows the first 10 lines (can be changed) of a file
    10. **tac [NAME]** - this command reads a file's lines in reverse older. Just for fun!
